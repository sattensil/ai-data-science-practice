    "[BigQuery ML](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/introduction) lets you train and do batch inference with machine learning models in BigQuery using standard SQL queries faster by eliminating the need to move data with fewer lines of code. [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) is Google Cloud's complimentary next generation, unified platform for machine learning development. By developing and deploying BQML machine learning solutions on Vertex AI, you can leverage a scalable online prediction service and MLOps tools for model retraining and monitoring to significantly enhance your development productivity, the ability to scale your workflow and decision making with your data, and accelerate time to value.\n",

See that blog post and accompanying tutorial for additional depth on this use case and BigQuery ML. In this lab, you will go one step further and focus on how Vertex AI extends BQML's capabilities through online prediction so you can incorporate both customer churn predictions into decision making UIs such as [Looker dashboards](https://looker.com/google-cloud) but also online predictions directly into customer applications to power targeted interventions such as targeted incentives."

    "According to a [2019 study](https://gameanalytics.com/reports/mobile-gaming-industry-analysis-h1-2019) on 100K mobile games by the Mobile Gaming Industry Analysis, most mobile games only see a 25% retention rate for users after the first 24 hours, known and any game \"below 30% retention generally needs improvement\". For mobile game developers, improving user retention is critical to revenue stability and increasing profitability. In fact, [Bain & Company research](https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers) found that 5% growth in retention rate can result in a 25-95% increase in profits. With lower costs to retain existing customers, the business objective for game developers is clear: reduce churn and improve customer loyalty to drive long-term profitability.\n",

    "To provide further context to your model performance, you can use the [ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-global-explain#get_global_feature_importance_for_each_class_of_a_boosted_tree_classifier_model) function which leverages Vertex Explainable AI as a back-end. [Vertex Explainable AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/explainable-ai) helps you understand your model's outputs for classification and regression tasks. Specifically, Vertex AI tells you how much each feature in the data contributed to your model's predicted result. You can then use this information to verify that the model is behaving as expected, identify and mitigate biases in your models, and get ideas for ways to improve your model and your training data."

    "Congratulations! In this lab, you trained, tuned, explained, and deployed a BigQuery ML user churn model to generate high business impact batch and online churn predictions to target customers likely to churn with interventions such as in-game rewards and reminder notifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you used `user_psuedo_id` as a user identifier. As next steps, you can extend this code further by having your application return a `user_id` to Google Analytics so you can join your model's predictions with additional first-party data such as purchase history and marketing engagement data. This enables you to integrate batch predictions into Looker dashboards to help product teams prioritize user experience improvements and marketing teams create targeted user interventions such as reminder emails to improve retention. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through having your model in Vertex AI Prediction, you also have a scalable prediction service to call from your application to directly integrate online predictions in order to to tailor personalized user game experiences and allow for targeted habit-building notifications.\n",

    "As you collect more data from your users, you may want to regularly evaluate your model on fresh data and re-train the model if you notice that the model quality is decaying. [Vertex Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/introduction) can help you to automate, monitor, and govern your ML solutions by orchestrating your BQML workflow in a serverless manner, and storing your workflow's artifacts using [Vertex ML Metadata](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/ml-metadata/introduction).
